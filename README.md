# test-vectors-corpus

The corpus of [interoperable test vectors for Filecoin implementations](https://github.com/filecoin-project/test-vectors).

Currently this is a _mirror_ of the `corpus/` directory in [filecoin-project/test-vectors](https://github.com/filecoin-project/test-vectors).

This repo has a github action that runs hourly to generate the corpus from [filecoin-project/test-vectors](https://github.com/filecoin-project/test-vectors). Pull requests are sent for any changes to the generated vectors.
